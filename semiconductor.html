                                <h5><b>Semiconductor</b></h5>
                                <p>Semiconductor is a very important class of materials because of wide applications in this
                                    modern world. The following are the properties which gives a rough description of a
                                    semiconductor.
                                </p>
                                <p>1. The electrical conductivity of a semiconductor is generally intermediate in magnitude
                                      between that of a conductor and an insulator. That means conductivity is roughly
                                      in the range of 10(3) to 10(−8) siemens per centimeter.</p>
                                <p>2. The electrical conductivity of a semiconductor varies widely with doping concentration,
                                      temperature and carrier injection.</p>
                                <p>3.Semiconductors have two types of charge carriers, electrons and holes.</p>
                                <p>4. Unlike metals, the number of charge carriers in semiconductors largely varies with
                                      temperature.</p>
                                <p>5. Generally, in case of semiconductor, increase of temperature enhances conductivity
                                      while in case of metals increase of temperature reduces conductivity.</p>
                                <p>6. The semiconductor can be best understood in the light of energy band model of
                                    solid.</p>

                                                                (c) Other Metal  (d) Gesemiconductor</p>
                                 

                                 <h5><b>Energy band structure of solid</b></h5>
                                <p>Atom has discrete energy levels. When atoms are arranged in a periodic arrangement in
                                    a solid the relatively outer shell electrons no longer remain in a specific discrete energy
                                    level. Rather they form a continuous energy level, called energy band. In case of semiconductor
                                    and insulator, at temperature 0K all the energy levels up to a certain energy band,
                                    called valence band, are completely filled with electrons, while next upper band (called
                                    conduction band) remains completely empty. The gap between bottom of the conduction
                                    band and top of the valence band is called fundamental energy band gap (Eg), which is
                                    a forbidden gap for electronic energy states. In case of metals, valence band is either
                                    partially occupied by electrons or valence band has an overlap with conduction band, as
                                    shown in Fig. 4.1(b and c).</p>
                                <p>In case of semiconductor, the band gap (~0 − 4eV ) is such that electrons can move
                                    from valence band to conduction band by absorbing thermal energy. When electron moves
                                    from valence band (VB) to conduction band (CB), it leaves behind a vacant state in
                                    valence band, called hole. When electric field is applied, movement of large number of
                                    electrons in the valence band can be visualized by the movement of hole as a positive
                                    charge particle. The Eg is a very important characteristic property of semiconductor which
                                    dictates it’s electrical, optical and optoelectrical properties. There are two main types of</p>

                                    impurity. Extrinsic semiconductors are doped with impurities. These discrete impurity
                                    energy levels lie in the forbidden gap. In p-type semiconductor, acceptor impurity, which
                                    can accept an electron, lies close to the valence band and in n-type semiconductor, donor</p>

                                <h5><b> Temperature variation of carrier concentration</b></h5>
                                <p>Fig. 4.3 shows the variation of carrier concentration (concentration of holes) in a ptype
                                    semiconductor with respect to 1000/T , where T is the temperature. Initially as
                                    temperature increases from 0K (i.e. ionization region), the discrete impurity vacant states
                                    starts getting filled up from valence band, which creates holes in valence band. Beyond a
                                    certain temperature all the impurity states will be filled up with electrons, which lead to
                                    the saturation region.</p>
                                <p>As temperature increases to further higher values, electrons, in the valence band, get
                                    sufficient energy to occupy empty states of conduction band (C.B). This region is called
                                    intrinsic region. The temperature above which the semiconductor behaves like intrinsic
                                    semiconductor is called “Intrinsic temperature”.</p>


                                 <h5><b> Conductivity of a semiconductor</b></h5>
                                <p>The conductivity of a semiconductor is given by </p>(4.1)
                                <p align="center"><img src="resources/images/e3/e3.1.jpg"></p>
                                <p>Where μn and μp refer to the mobilities of the electrons and holes, and n and p refer to
                                    the density of electrons and holes, respectively. The mobility is drift velocity per electric
                                    field applied across the material, μ = Vd/E. Mobility of a charge carrier can get affected
                                    by different scattering processes.</p>



                                <h5><b> Effects of temperature on conductivity of a semiconductor</b></h5>
                                <p>In the semiconductor, both mobility and carrier concentration are temperature dependent.
                                    So conductivity as a function of temperature can be expressed by</p>(4.2)
                                <p align="center"><img src="resources/images/e3/e3.2.jpg"></p>
                                <p>One interesting special case is when temperature is above intrinsic temperature where mobility
                                    is dominated by only lattice scattering (/ T−3/2). That means in this temperature
                                    region mobility decreases with increase of temperature as T−3/2 due to increase of thermal
                                    vibration of atoms in a solid.</p>
                                <p>In the intrinsic region, n ~ p ~ ni, where ni is the intrinsic carrier concentration.
                                       The intrinsic carrier concentration is given by</p>(4.3)
                                <p align="center"><img src="resources/images/e3/e3.3.jpg"></p>
                                <p>where, m(n)* and m(p)* are effective mass of electron and hole. Here the exponential

                                <h5><b>Four probe technique</b></h5>  
                                <p>Four probe technique is generally used for the measurement of resistivity of semiconductor
                                    sample. Before we introduce four probe technique, it is important to know two probe
                                    techniques by which you measured resistivity of a nicrome wire. In two probe technique,
                                    two probes (wires) are connected to a sample to supply constant current and measure
                                    voltage. In the case of nicrome wire (1st experiment), connections are made by pressing
                                    the multimeter probes on nichrome wire. The contact between metal to metal probe of
                                    multimeter does not create appreciable contact resistance. But in the case of semiconductor
                                    the metal – semiconductor contact gives rise to high contact resistance. If two probe
                                    configuration is followed for semiconductor sample, voltmeter measures the potential drop
                                    across the resistance of the sample as well as the contact resistance. This is shown in the
                                    Fig. 4.4(a).</p>
                                <p>The potential drop across high contact resistance can be avoided by using four probe
                                    technique. In the four probe configuration, two outer probes are used to supply current
                                    and two inner probes are used to measure potential difference. When a digital voltmeter
                                    with very high impedance is connected to the inner two probes, almost no current goes
                                    through the voltmeter. So, the potential drop it measures, is only the potential drop
                                    across the sample resistance. This is shown in the equivalent circuit diagram given in
                                    Fig. 4.4(b). From the measurement of current supplied and voltage drop across the sample,
                                    the resistance can be found out. Resistivity of a sample is given by  = cV/I, where c is
                                    a constant</p>
                                <p>For the specific arrangement, where the probes are equispaced with the distance between
                                    two successive probes as a, and the thickness of the sample is h, the resistivity can
                                    be calculated by the following formulas.</p>
                                <p><b>CASE-1: </b> h >> a. In this case it is assumed that the four probes are far from the 
                                        edge of the sample and the sample is placed on an insulating material to avoid leakage current. The resistivity in this case is given by</p>(4.5)

                                 <p>This is the setup used for our experiment.</p>

                                  <p> Once resistivity (ρ) is determined, conductivity (σ) can be calculated by taking reciprocal

                                <ul>
                                  <li>The key advantage of four-terminal sensing is that the separation of current and
                                      voltage electrodes eliminates the impedance contribution of the wiring and contact
                                      resistances.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>If the probes are separated by equal distance a, and a << h then resistivity can be
                                        found out without knowing the exact shape and size of the sample.</li>
